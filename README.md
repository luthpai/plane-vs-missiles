## Play

I could not export it to Windows `.exe` file and Linux executable file, so I'd assume that you already have Python installed.

First, clone the repository :
```sh
git clone https://github.com/luthpai/plane-vs-missiles.git
cd plane-vs-missiles
```

Then, install the required packages : 
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And you can play by running the `main.py` file :
```sh
python main.py
```
